Testing, Linters and code coverage 


## Tests, linters and code coverage

To run the test suite:

    python manage.py test

To run the test suite and get code coverage statistics:

    coverage run manage.py test
    coverage report

To generate HTML reports, run this and open `htmlcov/index.html`
afterwards:

    coverage html

To format the code automatically using `black`, run it
from the project root directory:

    black .

To check for common programming errors or style problems,
run `ruff` linter in the project root directory:

    ruff --fix .

To automatically run `black` (formatting), `ruff` (linter)
and `isort` (sort/format package imports) on every git
commit, set up a git `pre-commit` hook:

    pre-commit install

Note that you'll need to have initialized your git repository for
the git pre-commit hook to be available. To test it without installation,
you can run:

    pre-commit run --all-files

## Continuous integration with GitHub Actions

This project comes with a GitHub Actions workflow that runs
the test suite and linters on every push to the repository.

See the `.github/workflows/django.yml` file for details.
